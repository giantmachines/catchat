# CATCHAT 🐈

Catchat is a cat-themed chat application! Catchat v1 has two great features:

1. A chat room.
2. MeowMasking®, which replaces certain words with "meow" when they appear in chat.

**Objective**: Your job is to take Catchat to the next level (v2) by adding authentication. 

After you finish v2, move on to v3, which adds authorization.

Here's our planned feature matrix:

|    | Messaging | Usernames | MeowMasking® Admin |
|----|-----------|-----------|--------------------|
| v1 | yes       | no        | no                 |
| v2 | yes       | yes       | no                 |
| v3 | yes       | yes       | yes                |


# Catchat v2 - Authentication

Catchat v1 comes with these components:

- React frontend client
- Node backend server

You will add a third component: an Azure Active Directory identity provider (aka Azure AD) to store chat users. Then you'll update the client and server code to integrate with the identity provider.

## Architecture Notes

Catchat v1 is a simple client-server chat application. The server holds a list of messages, and the client can add to this list and poll for new messages. The client updates the masks list similarly.

Catchat v2 (and v3) will use the Oauth protocol to authenticate with Azure AD. Oauth (with OpenID Connect) is the industry standard authentication protocol identity providers use under the hood, and it defines the ways in which authenticating entities communicate to handle delegated authentication scenarios.

Here's a diagram of one Oauth flow. 

![](images/Oauth.png?raw=true)

It's helpful to understand this diagram when dealing with authentication, but luckily we can use SDK's and libraries to hide many of the details of implementing Oauth. For Catchat we'll use a library called MSAL that takes care of exchanging the auth code for an access token, getting new refresh tokens, redirecting to the Identity Provider (Idp), and other low-level concerns.

This means we can get the tokens in a fairly straightforward way, and focus on how we use the tokens in our application, rather than how we fetch them. 

Catchat will thus fetch the tokens via MSAL, then send an access and/or id token with API requests, as applicable:

![](images/ClientServer.png?raw=true)


## Start Catchat

Before making changes, let's explore Catchat v1. 

Clone the repo to your local machine, checkout the **v1** tag, and start the server. 

Note: You may see a message from git about having a detached HEAD. This is normal.

```
git checkout v1
cd server
npm install
npm run build && npm run start
```

Then in another console window, instantiate a `.env` file and start the client:

```
cd client
npm install
echo "SERVER_URI=http://localhost:3000" >> .env
npm run watch
```

Now you can chat! Open up http://localhost:8080 in a browser, and you should be able to send messages to yourself. You can open the client up in other browsers (or a private window) to create additional users.

Play with the application, take a look at the code, and see if you can answer these questions. 

#### Questions

-  Where do the chat users' names come from?
-  How do messages get sent between users?
-  How does meow-masking work?
-  What happens when you restart the server?

## Set up Identity Provider

An **Identity Provider** is an entity that provides services for authenticating users. We will use Microsoft Azure AD for our identity provider. 

Azure AD is free, but **you will need to set up an account on Microsoft Azure first. We won't cover the process for signing up for Azure here.**

Once you have an Azure account, follow these instructions to set up Azure AD to work with Catchat.

#### Navigating Azure

The Azure portal can sometimes feel like a labyrinth of menus and settings. You will probably get lost.

A few pointers to help find your way:

- After you create a tenant (next step), find your way back to it by typing _Azure Active Directory_ in the **Search Bar** at the top of the portal.

![](images/azure-search.png?raw=true)

- Return to the Azure home screen by clicking the Azure logo.
- If you are logged in as the wrong user, go to **Sign in with a different account** in the top-right menu.
- If you are logged in to the wrong directory, go to **Switch directory** in the top-right menu.

### Create an Azure AD tenant

First we'll create an Azure AD **tenant**. A tenant is an instance of Azure AD dedicated to a single organization. Each tenant has a **directory**, which serves as the identity provider for the tenant. 

Catchat's users, permissions, and application settings will all live in this directory.

Note: If you already have an Azure account with multiple directories, complete these steps from the **Default Directory**. (If you don't know what this means, feel free to ignore this warning and proceed).

1. Go to portal.azure.com.
2. Select **Create a resource**. 
3. Search for **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Select **Create**.
5. For tenant type, select **Azure Active Directory** (not B2C!)
6. Provide a clever oganization name and domain name.
7. Select **Review and Create**.
8. Once the tenant is created, click the generated link to visit it, or use the **Switch Directory** link under your username.

You should now see a screen that looks like this:

![](images/AzureAD.png?raw=true)

Explore this page a bit and try to answer these questions.

#### Questions

- What users does your directory currently contain?
- What time did you first sign in to this directory, and from what IP address?
- How can you switch to another tenant?

### Create a User

Now that we have a directory, let's add a user to it.

1. From the directory page, select **Users**.
2. Select **New User**.
3. Fill in the required fields.
4. Copy username and the initial password.
5. Select **Create**.

Let's now log in as that user and set a password.

1. In the sign-in menu on the upper-right, select **Sign in with a different account**.
2. Enter the user credentials into the login form.
3. Change your password when prompted.

You should now be logged in to the Azure portal as the user you just created.

#### Questions

- What settings in the directory are available / unavailable to this user?
- Can you reset your own password from the directory?
- Can you add new users?

### Add App Registrations 

In this step we'll create **app registrations** in Azure AD. An app registration configures authentication workflows and settings for apps that use the directory. 

We'll create two app registrations, one for the Catchat backend, and one for the frontend.

Before beginning, make sure you are logged in as the admin user that created your tenant.

#### Backend registration

##### Register the app

1. Go to the main Azure AD page. 
2. Select **App registrations**.
3. Select **New registration**.
4. For "Name", enter `API`.
5. For "Supported Account Types", select **Accounts in any organizational directory - Multitenant**. 
6. Select **Register**. This should open up the settings for your new app.

![](images/backend-registration.png?raw=true)

##### Add authentication settings

1. In the app settings, select **Expose an API**.
2. Set the **Application ID URI** to a friendly but unique name, like `api://my-cat-chat`.
3. Select **Add a scope**.

![](images/add-scope.png?raw=true)

5.  For **Scope name**, put `Chat.Messaging`.
6.  For **Who can consent**, select `Admins and users`.
7.  For **Admin consent display name**, put `Allow reading and writing chat messages`.
8.  For **Admin consent description**, put the same message, or whatever you like.
9.  Select **Add Scope** to save.

#### Frontend registration

##### Register the app

1. Go to the main Azure AD page. 
2. Select **App registrations**.
3. Select **New registration**.
4. For "Name", enter `SPA`.
5. For "Supported Account Types", select **Accounts in any organizational directory - Multitenant**. 
6. For "Redirect URI" select **Single-page application** and enter `http://localhost:8080`.
7. Select **Register**. This should open up the settings for your new app.

##### Add authentication settings

1. In the app settings, select **Authentication**.
2. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows** check the boxes next to **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Navigate to **API permissions**.
5. Select **Add a permission**.
6. In the form that appears, navigate to **My APIs** and select the API you created for the backend.
7. Select **Delegated permissions**.
8. Check the box next to the permission you created earlier.
9. Click **Add permission** to save.

## Add authentication code to frontend 

Now it's time to integrate Catchat with our identity provider. We'll start with the frontend.

### Set up environment variables

Catchat uses a library called MSAL to talk to Azure AD. Catchat already has the MSAL package installed, but we'll need to configure the library so it can find our tenant and app. We'll store these settings in environment variables, and use the `dotenv` package for local development.

You already created a .env file earlier to hold the server URI. Open the file and add these variables: 

```
CLIENT_ID=<SPA_APPLICATION_ID>
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080
SERVER_URI=http://localhost:3000
AUTHORITY=https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/
KNOWN_AUTHORITY=login.microsoft.com
SCOPE=<API_APPLICATION_ID_URI>/Chat.Messaging
```

You can find the two custom settings in your Azure AD directory:
- The `SPA_APPLICATION_ID` appears on the overview pane of the SPA app registration page. 
- The `API_APPLICATION_ID_URI` appears on the overview pane of the API app registration page, for example `api://my-cat-chat`.

### Instantiate MSAL

Now we'll [create an instance of MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/initialization.md) so the frontend can talk to Azure AD. 

Open `client/src/authenticate.ts`. This is where we'll store the base-level authentication code which the frontend code will interact with.

First, import MSAL.

```typescript
import * as msal from '@azure/msal-browser';
```

Next, pull in the environment variables and add them to a configuration object.

```typescript
const CLIENT_ID = process.env.CLIENT_ID;
const REDIRECT_URI = process.env.REDIRECT_URI;
const AUTHORITY = process.env.AUTHORITY;
const KNOWN_AUTHORITY = process.env.KNOWN_AUTHORITY;  
const SCOPE = process.env.SCOPE;

const msalConfig = {
  auth: {
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
    authority: AUTHORITY,
    knownAuthorities: [KNOWN_AUTHORITY],
    postLogoutRedirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
  }
};
```

Finally, pass the configuration object to the constructor of `PublicClientApplication` to create an instance.

```typescript
const msalInstance = new msal.PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);
```

### Create login function 

We can call methods on `msalInstance` to perform authentication tasks. The first thing we should implement is a function to log users in. 

Refer to [this documentation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/login-user.md), and implement the `login` function.

Notes:
- Use the "redirect" interaction type.
- Include a `scopes` option when calling the MSAL method using the `SCOPE` env variable you imported.

### Create logout function

Use [this documentation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/logout.md) to create a `logout` function.

Notes:
- Use the "redirect" interaction type.
- There should be no need to pass any arguments to the MSAL `logout` function.

### Gather ye tokens

When we call the MSAL method to log a user in, it will redirect the browser to a Microsoft login screen. If login is successful, the login screen will redirect the browser back to Catchat, with an authorization code. MSAL will then call Azure AD with the authorization code, and exchange it for tokens, which our app can use.

Create a function called `getTokens` that calls `handleRedirectPromise()` to retrieve tokens. The `getTokens` function should return an object that contains the raw access token, and claims from the ID token, (like the user's name):

```typescript
{
  accessToken
  idClaims
}
```

See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-js-initializing-client-applications) for details on `handleRedirectPromise`.


### Add a login header

Let's use the authentication functions we created to improve the user experience of Catchat.

Users should have button to log in and log out, and their name should appear to confirm they've logged in. Luckily, Catchat already includes a component to encapsulate these features, called `LoginHeader.tsx`.

Replace the static `h1` header in Catchat v1 with the `LoginHeader` component. 

Hint on how to set this up: create a `useEffect` hook in App.tsx which sets the token in state, and pass the username from the token to the `name` prop in `LoginHeader`.

### Add username to chat messages

With the login header in place, we can log in and log out, and we can see our name, but we're still using a randomly-generated username in chat. Let's fix that.

Replace the random user with relevant claims sent back in the token response, so that chat users see their own names next to chat messages.

## Protect server endpoints 

So far we've used information found in the ID token to enhance the Catchat user experience, but we haven't really secured the application. Let's update the server so that only users with valid access tokens can use Catchat.

First we'll add server middleware which will decode the access token, read its claims, and verify specific claims. 

With the server checking access tokens, the client will no longer have access to its endpoints. So we'll also update the client's API layer to send an access token with each request.

### Set up dependencies

We want our chat server to inspect access tokens coming from the client and verify each token, but what exactly should we verify about the token? We can check any part of the token we'd like, such as specific claims, header information, and whether the signature is valid. 

If we need a robust solution to cover a lot of token validation scenarios, we'll probably want to use an authentication library such as Passport. But to start out, let's simply check specific claims manually. 

#### Add environment variables

Create a `.env` file for the server.

```
cd server
touch .env
```

Then add two entries to the `.env` file.

```
CLIENT_APP_ID=<CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID>
AUDIENCE=<API_APPLICATION_ID_URI>
```

You can find the two custom settings in your Azure AD directory:
- The `CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID` appears on the overview pane of the SPA app registration page. 
- The `API_APPLICATION_ID_URI` appears on the overview pane of the API app registration page, for example `api://my-cat-chat`.

Next, open `server/src/index.ts` and pull the enviroment variables in. Add these constant declarations below the `dotenv` call:

```typescript
require('dotenv').config();

const CLIENT_APP_ID = process.env.CLIENT_APP_ID;
const AUDIENCE = process.env.AUDIENCE;
```

#### Add libraries

Add these imports to the server as well:

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { decode, JwtPayload } from 'jsonwebtoken';
```

The imports from `express` will allow us to create a middleware. The imports from `jsonwebtoken` will allow us to read the contents of the access token.


### Parse access token claims

In order to verify the claims in an access token, we must first decode it.

Create a utility function called `parseClaims` which should decode tokens. It should have a signature like this:

```typescript
(token: string) => JwtPayload | null
```

### Implement middleware

With our `parseClaims` function, we can now read access tokens and verify their contents. We want to do this on each request to the server, but how?

We could add code to each endpoint that performs this check. However, this approach would mean repeating the same authentication code in multiple places, making that code brittle and difficult to maintain. Extracting the authentication code into a separate function would help with these issues, but we still run the risk of forgetting to call the authentication function when we add a new endpoint.

Instead, we can write an Express *middleware*. 

Our middleware will inspect each incoming request before it reaches an endpoint, inspect its access token, and return an error status to the client if the token check fails.

See the [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) on writing middleware for more information.

#### Write middleware function

Create a function called `accessTokenValidator` with the following signature:

```typescript
(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => void
```

The function should:

- Pull the access token from the **authorization header** of each request;
- Parse the claims from the token;
- Compare the `aud` claim with the `AUDIENCE` environment variable;
- Compare the `appid` claim with the `CLIENT_APP_ID` environment variable;
- Return a 401 status code if either claim does not match;
- Pass the request on to its handler if both claims match.

Use this middleware for all requests.

### Send access tokens from client

With the chat server authenticating requests, the client must now send an access token with each request.

Update the API functions in `client/src/api.ts` so that they pass a Bearer token in the Authorization header. (Be sure to include the string `Bearer`). 

Then update any applicable frontend code so that it passes the access token to these API functions.

If you've hooked everything up correctly, you should only be able to send and receive chat messages with a valid access token.

## Wrapping up

Congratulations, you've finished Catchat v2!

### Key takeaways

- You can use an OAuth-compliant identity provider like Azure Active Directory as a user database.
- Tokens carry all the information you need for many authentication scenarios.
- Use a library like MSAL to abstract over OAuth details like refresh tokens and caching.

### Check your work

If you'd like to see how your solution compares to ours, take a look at the **v2** tag.

```

Proceed to the next section for an additional Catchat enhancement.

# Catchat v3 - Authorization

With Catchat v2, we added **identity** to the application. This means we can restrict access to only authenticated users, and we can provide these users with a somewhat customized experience. For instance, we can now attach names to messages. 

But we can only do so much with authentication alone.

Remember the MeowMasking® feature? Currently any user can add new masks, which may become a problem as Catchat grows. Since masking affects the chat experience for all users, we should restrict who can add to and remove words from the mask list.  

The solution? We need an **authorization** piece for the MeowMasker, which:

1. Displays the MeowMasking UI to authorized users only.
2. Restricts access to `/masks` endpoints to authorized users only.

How do we distinguish authorized from non-authorized users? We'll segment our users into two **roles**: `User` and `Admin`. Users are normal chat users, and Admins will have the ability to update the MeowMasker.

Once we can assign a role to a user, the role will appear in the user's ID token, which will allow the application to authorize them.

## Set up roles in Identity Provider

Azure AD includes a number of built-in roles, but these relate to using and administering Azure AD itself. We will instead use the **App role** feature to create roles just for Catchat.

### Create more test users

Since Catchat will now have both Admins and Users, we should have at least two test users in our directory to play with.

If you haven't already, create one or more additional test users in your directory. We will assign the Admin role to one of them later.

### Add App roles

Let's create our custom app roles.

1. Go to your directory in the Azure portal.
2. Go to **App registrations**.
3. Open up the `SPA` registration page.
4. Go to **App roles**.
5. Select **Create app role**, repeat for each role.

#### User role

1. For **Display name**, enter `Users`.
2. For **Allowed member types** select **Users/Groups**.
3. For **Value** enter `Chat.User`.
4. For **Description** enter `Chat users can send messages in the chat`.
5. For **Do you want to enable this app role?**, select yes.
6. Click **Apply** when finished.

#### Users role

1. For **Display name**, enter `Admins`.
2. For **Allowed member types** select **Users/Groups**.
3. For **Value** enter `Chat.Admin`.
4. For **Description** enter `Chat admins can configure chat settings.`.
5. For **Do you want to enable this app role?**, select yes.
6. Click **Apply** when finished.

### Assign Admin role to user 

Now that we have the Admin role, we can make one lucky user an admin.

Follow these steps to assign the Admin role to a user:

1. Go to the main page of your directory.
2. Select **Enterprise Applications**.
3. Select the `SPA` application.
4. Select **Users and Groups** from the left sidebar.
5. Select **Add user/group**.
6. Click the link under **Users**. 
7. Click the user you want to grant the Admin role to, then **Select**.
8. Click the link under **Select a role**.
9. Click **Admins**, then **Select**. 
10. Click **Assign**.

## Set up frontend

We have two tasks to complete on the frontend.

- Hide the MeowMasker UI from non-admins.
- Pass the ID token to the server when updating mask settings.

### Hide the MeowMasker

With the roles now in place, you should be able to see which roles (if any) are assigned to the user when inspecting the ID token claims.

Update the frontend code so that the `MaskSettings` component only displays if the user has the `Chat.Admin` role.

You should see the MeowMasker UI when logged in as an admin user, and not see it when you're not.

### Pass the ID token

The frontend can safely use the role from the ID token to display the `MaskSettings` component, which is just UI. But for actually updating the list of masks on the server, we should not trust the frontend to tell the server what role the user has. Instead, we'll pass the full ID token to the server so it can parse and verify it itself. 

Update the frontend code so that `postMasks` sends the full ID token string to the server, contained in a header called `id-token`. 

## Authorize requests on the backend

The frontend should now send the ID token whenever it sends a POST request to the `/masks` endpoint. Let's lock down the endpoint so that only admins can update masks.

Update the `/masks` POST endpoint so that it:

- Parses claims from the ID token
- Allows the request to proceed if the token includes `Chat.Admin` in the role claim.
- Returns a 403 status if this check fails.

If everything is set up correctly, you won't be able to update the masks store unless the token is valid and contains the correct role. (As with the access token, for a more robust solution we would also validate the token signature, but that's beyond our scope.)

## Wrapping up

You've finished Catchat v3, adding an authorization layer to the MeowMasker. Congratulations!


### Key takeaways

- When users have different levels of access, configure these levels as roles in the identity provider.
- Use the ID token when you need information about a user.

### Check your work

To compare with our version, take a look at the **v3** tag.
